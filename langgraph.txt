LangGraph is an open-source library from LangChain used to build and manage complex, stateful, multi-agent AI workflows. 

It utilizes a graph-based architecture, where nodes represent individual steps or agents and edges represent the flow between them, enabling complex logic with cycles, loops, and conditional execution. 

This allows for state persistence, real-time streaming, moderation, and custom control flows, making it ideal for creating advanced systems like virtual assistants, task management assistants, and other complex conversational AI applications
